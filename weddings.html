<h2 class="center">Wonderful Music For Your Wedding Day</h2>
<blockquote>&quot;Thank you for all the wonderful music you played. You made the day extra 
special. So many people said how nice it was and how it went very well with the venue.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Thanks for doing such a great job peforming at our wedding.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Create a perfect atmosphere for your Wedding Day with beautiful music played by the Greenwich String 
Quartet. Walk down the aisle to your own special piece; create a wonderful ambience as your guests gather 
and await the bride's arrival; entertain your guests throughout the day during canapes, drinks and the wedding
breakfast.  The quartet has an extensive <a href="repertoire.html">repertoire</a>, ranging from classical to jazz, light, show/film, latin and 
pop.  Something for everyone !</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Your performance was perfectly brilliant and so appreciated by us and all of our guests
throughout the day.&quot;</blockquote>
<blockquote>&quot;Your performance was fantastic and was the icing on the cake to make our ceremony perfect!&quot;</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Before the ceremony commences, we usually play for fifteen minutes or half 
an hour as the guests arrive. Our repertoire includes Bach&apos;s Air in D and 
Brandenburg Concerto no.3, Handel&apos;s Hornpipe from the Water Music Suite 
and Mozart&apos;s Divertimenti and Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. For the bride&apos;s 
processional we are often requested to play Pachelbel&apos;s Canon, Handel&apos;s 
Arrival of the Queen of Sheba or Wagner&apos;s Bridal Chorus. During the 
signing of the register the quartet can play one or two short pieces, and  
finally, Mendelssohn&apos;s Wedding March is a much requested piece for the 
recessional. Of course, these are suggestions only!</p>

<p>We can continue on to the drinks reception and/or the wedding breakfast. In 
  the summer, if drinks are served outdoors we are happy to play, as long as 
  we have adequate shade to protect the instruments. We will also include, if 
  you wish, jazz, pop and show numbers as well as our classical repertoire. 
  Please see our <a href="repertoire.html">repertoire page</a> for a full list.  </p>
<p>If you wish to book the quartet only for your ceremony, reception or meal  
  we will accommodate any  requirements you may have.</p>
